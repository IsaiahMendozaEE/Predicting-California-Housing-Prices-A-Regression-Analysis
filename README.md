Project title:
Predicting-California-Housing-Prices-A-Regression-Analysis

Description:
This project focuses on building a regression based machine learning model to predict housing prices in California. The motivation behind this study is to better understand median income, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, population, latitude, and longitude have the strongest impact on home prices. By applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and regression modeling techniques, our goal is to evaluate how accurately home prices can be predicted from publicly available housing data.
